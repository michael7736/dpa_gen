LLM core (for reasoning and generation), a Retriever (handling search queries),
and an External Memory Store (vector database). The Retriever encodes


## 2025-07-05T22:56:19.974649
inputs into embeddings, searches the vector index, and returns top documents.


## 2025-07-05T22:56:20.042026
These are then concatenated (with the input) into a prompt for the LLM, which


## 2025-07-05T22:56:20.117294
generates the output. In memory-augmented networks, the architecture adds a
Memory Module (matrix of vectors) that is interfaced via differentiable


## 2025-07-05T22:56:20.185592
read/write heads by the controller network (as in DNCs or Memory Networks).
Implementation Strategies: When implementing memory, several strategies


## 2025-07-05T22:56:20.255860
emerge:
Continuous Learning Pipelines: Maintain a pipeline to ingest new data into
memory. For example, after each user interaction, extract relevant


## 2025-07-05T22:56:20.323900
knowledge and append to a knowledge base or vector store. Use
background jobs to update embeddings and indexes.

## 2025-07-05T22:56:20.463177
Hierarchical Memory: Split memory into levels (short-term buffer vs. long-
term store). Frequently accessed items can reside in fast memory; older


## 2025-07-05T22:56:20.530276
items can be archived. For instance, chat messages within the last n turns
are kept in a short history buffer, while older messages are summarized


## 2025-07-05T22:56:20.597445
and stored in a long-term store.
Indexed Databases: Use specialized vector databases (Pinecone, Qdrant,


## 2025-07-05T22:56:20.668192
Milvus, etc.) that handle sharding, replication, and approximate search.
These often provide Python APIs and integrations (e.g. LangChainʼs


## 2025-07-05T22:56:20.733668
VectorStoreMemory) to simplify embedding and retrieval. One can choose
flat indices (exact search) for small data, or HNSW graphs for large-scale,


## 2025-07-05T22:56:20.804348
low-latency retrieval.
Attention Masks & Context Window Extensions: For working memory,


## 2025-07-05T22:56:20.869270
techniques like attention masks or cache (as in Transformer-XL) allow
partial reuse of previous tokens as “memory” without fully reprocessing


## 2025-07-05T22:56:20.935427
them. This extends the effective context length.
Summary Memory: Periodically summarize older conversations (using an


## 2025-07-05T22:56:21.004968
LLM) to condense memory. For example, after every 10 messages, the
agent might run a summarization prompt to compress those into a short


## 2025-07-05T22:56:21.071053
note, then discard the raw text.
Code Examples: In addition to the snippets above, here are a few illustrative
pieces:


## 2025-07-05T22:56:21.136365
pieces:
Fine-Tuning for Memory: One can fine-tune an LLM on newly acquired
knowledge. For instance:
python Copy


## 2025-07-05T22:56:21.205431
python Copy
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, T
model_name = "gpt2-medium"


## 2025-07-05T22:56:21.281002
model_name = "gpt2-medium"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)


## 2025-07-05T22:56:21.354306
# Example new memory (could be conversation logs or facts)
new_text = "Alice has a meeting with Bob on Tuesday. "


## 2025-07-05T22:56:21.436551
inputs = tokenizer(new_text, return_tensors="pt")
# Fine-tune on this text (using a small number of steps for ill

## 2025-07-05T22:56:21.568939
5/14/25, 1:53 PM ChatGPT - Shared Content
trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_datase
trainer.train()


## 2025-07-05T22:56:21.638142
trainer.train()
After fine-tuning, the model “remembers” the new facts in its weights,
effectively merging long-term memory into the neural network.


## 2025-07-05T22:56:21.699285
Vector Store Retrieval (LangChain-style): Many agent frameworks
encapsulate retrieval. For example, using LangChain pseudocode:
python Copy


## 2025-07-05T22:56:21.768556
python Copy
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS


## 2025-07-05T22:56:21.836789
# Assume `docs` is a list of Document objects containing text.
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()


## 2025-07-05T22:56:21.909122
vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings) # Builds
# On query:
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k":3})


## 2025-07-05T22:56:21.969800
related_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents("What did I tel
Here, the vector store retrieves the top 3 documents relevant to the query,


## 2025-07-05T22:56:22.047424
which the agent can include in its prompt.
Transformer-XL Recurrence: In frameworks like PyTorch, one can


## 2025-07-05T22:56:22.106819
implement context reuse by passing previously computed hidden states:
python Copy
# Pseudocode for Transformer-XL style recurrence (conceptual)


## 2025-07-05T22:56:22.178091
prev_hidden = None
for segment in segmented_input:
output, new_hidden = transformer(input_ids=segment, past_ke


## 2025-07-05T22:56:22.253037
prev_hidden = new_hidden # carry memory forward
Each segmentʼs hidden states ( ) act as memory for the
past_key_values
next segment.


## 2025-07-05T22:56:22.321944
past_key_values
next segment.

(memory size, compute power). The combination of learned memory (via weights)

and external, retrievable memory (via databases) gives AI agents both flexibility and
power.

power.
Overall, memory systems in AI agents remain an active research area. Developers

must carefully architect hybrid solutions: using LLM context for short-term and

long-term memory. The cited systems above illustrate that practical agent memory


## 2025-07-05T22:56:22.928063
often means combining multiple approaches: e.g., an assistant like Charlie uses
RAG for knowledge and an explicit LTM module , while smaller bots may
