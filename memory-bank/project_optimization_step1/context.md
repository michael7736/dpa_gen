In memory-augmented networks, the architecture adds a
Memory Module (matrix of vectors) that is interfaced via differentiable
read/write heads by the controller network (as in DNCs or Memory Networks).
Implementation Strategies: When implementing memory, several strategies
emerge:
Continuous Learning Pipelines: Maintain a pipeline to ingest new data into
memory. For example, after each user interaction, extract relevant
knowledge and append to a knowledge base or vector store. Use
background jobs to update embeddings and indexes

Hierarchical Memory: Split memory into levels (short-term buffer vs. long-
term store). Frequently accessed items can reside in fast memory; older
items can be archived. For instance, chat messages within the last n turns
are kept in a short history buffer, while older messages are summarized
and stored in a long-term store.
Indexed Databases: Use specialized vector databases (Pinecone, Qdrant,
Milvus, etc.) that handle sharding, replication, and approximate search.
These often provide Python APIs and integrations (e.g. LangChainʼs
VectorStoreMemory) to simplify embedding and retrieval. One can choose
flat indices (exact search) for small data, or HNSW graphs for large-scale,
low-latency retrieval.
Attention Masks & Context Window Extensions: For working memory,
techniques like attention masks or cache (as in Transformer-XL) allow
partial reuse of previous tokens as “memory” without fully reprocessing
them. This extends the effective context length.
Summary Memory: Periodically summarize older conversations (using an
LLM) to condense memory. For example, after every 10 messages, the
agent might run a summarization prompt to compress those into a short
note, then discard the raw text

Code Examples: In addition to the snippets above, here are a few illustrative
pieces:
Fine-Tuning for Memory: One can fine-tune an LLM on newly acquired
knowledge. For instance:
python Copy
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, T
model_name = "gpt2-medium"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
# Example new memory (could be conversation logs or facts)
new_text = "Alice has a meeting with Bob on Tuesday. "
inputs = tokenizer(new_text, return_tensors="pt")
# Fine-tune on this text (using a small number of steps for ill
training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="fine-tune", num_t

5/14/25, 1:53 PM ChatGPT - Shared Content
trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_datase
trainer.train()
After fine-tuning, the model “remembers” the new facts in its weights,
effectively merging long-term memory into the neural network.
Vector Store Retrieval (LangChain-style): Many agent frameworks
encapsulate retrieval. For example, using LangChain pseudocode:
python Copy
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
# Assume `docs` is a list of Document objects containing text.
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings) # Builds
# On query:
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k":3})
related_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents("What did I tel
Here, the vector store retrieves the top 3 documents relevant to the query,
which the agent can include in its prompt

.
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings) # Builds
# On query:
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k":3})
related_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents("What did I tel
Here, the vector store retrieves the top 3 documents relevant to the query,
which the agent can include in its prompt.
Transformer-XL Recurrence: In frameworks like PyTorch, one can
implement context reuse by passing previously computed hidden states:
python Copy
# Pseudocode for Transformer-XL style recurrence (conceptual)
prev_hidden = None
for segment in segmented_input:
output, new_hidden = transformer(input_ids=segment, past_ke
prev_hidden = new_hidden # carry memory forward
Each segmentʼs hidden states ( ) act as memory for the
past_key_values
next segment.

Each of these code examples and architectural designs can be tuned to the specific
application (virtual assistant vs. autonomous agent) and to resource constraints
(memory size, compute power). The combination of learned memory (via weights)
and external, retrievable memory (via databases) gives AI agents both flexibility and
power.
Overall, memory systems in AI agents remain an active research area. Developers
must carefully architect hybrid solutions: using LLM context for short-term and
fine-tuning for embedded knowledge, while leveraging fast retrieval for scalable
long-term memory. The cited systems above illustrate that practical agent memory
often means combining multiple approaches: e.g., an assistant like Charlie uses
RAG for knowledge and an explicit LTM module , while smaller bots may

rely solely on prompt history and lightweight embedding stores. Addressing
scalability, consistency, and efficiency will be key to future progress.
